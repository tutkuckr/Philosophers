philo: add start barrier + fix first-cycle timing & thread-safety

- Set data->start_time once in start_threads() (now+50ms) and make philos
  wait until that timestamp (barrier with usleep(50)).
- Remove worker-side writes to start_time.
- Drop racy c_thread spin-wait in routine().
- Align last_meal_time to the mutex under m_meal.
- Avoid initial think delay: use m_print("is thinking") instead of
  print_and_skip_time for the very first log.
- Make is_done_eating() thread-safe (lock m_meal, use >= max_eat).

Notes:
- If init_philo() still initializes last_meal_time, remove it.
- Next: consider trylock on second fork and a first-cycle split for odd N.
